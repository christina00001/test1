# Test1

This repository hosts a simple GitHub Pages site that serves as a portfolio for an IT specialist. The site is contained in the `index.html` file and can be published using GitHub Pages.

## Hosting the site

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. On the repository page, go to **Settings** â†’ **Pages**.
3. Select the branch you want to publish (usually `main`) and save.
4. GitHub will provide a URL such as `https://<username>.github.io/home/` if you keep the `home/` directory in this repository. Remove the `home/` folder if you prefer the root page only.

After enabling GitHub Pages, your portfolio will be visible at the URL shown in the Pages settings.
